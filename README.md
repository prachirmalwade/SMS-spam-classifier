Spam Message Classifier, developed using Python and Streamlit. This project employs the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify text messages as either Spam or Ham, utilizing a Bag-of-Words approach for text vectorization.

Key Features:
- Real-time Classification: Users can input messages and receive instant predictions on spam detection.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless and intuitive experience.
- Efficient Model: Quick and accurate spam classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
- Data Validation: Implemented an 80/20 train-test split for effective model evaluation.
Technologies Used:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development, offering a practical solution for managing digital communications more effectively. ðŸŒŸ
